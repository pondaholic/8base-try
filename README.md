This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [8Base](https://www.8base.com), & [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## This started out from a tutorial found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/build-a-hackernews-clone-with-authentication-using-react-graphql-and-8base-d74d702ecb6d):

There were a few outdated/deprecated problems I ran into and I used 8base's own sandbox to help fix the auth problems.

**Note:The fix for the date-fns is to specify an older ^2.0.0 version. I didn't do so because it wasn't important for me to have that working in this sample.**

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**The page will error out because I have gitignored my own 8base credentials.**
